Design a set of C++ interfaces for controlling the audio transport in a DAW. Your design:

1.      should be suitable for an interactive musical application,

2.      should support changing the playback state, looping, and moving the position of the play head, 

3.      should show how audio rendering is affected by the audio transport control,

4.      should fully define types and interfaces explicitly,

5.      does not need to contain full implementations - logic may be sketched with pseudocode, as long as the key parts of your intended algorithms are well described, and

6.      should contain a description of the design considerations you made.

Develop both the unit tests and implementation for a stateless waveshaping saturator DSP unit that is to be used as a "soft clipper". 
Your code should be written in modern C++, and you should provide us with instructions for how to build and run your tests.

The soft clipper should support two different wave shapes as modes of distortion, and these can be of your choosing. 
If you need a specific testing framework to develop the tests, please use it, but make sure it is easy for us to build 
and run your tests on Unix systems.
